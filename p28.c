//28.	An operating system assigns job to print queues based on the number of pages to be printed (1 to 50 pages). You may assume that the system printers are able to print 10 page per minute. Smaller print jobs are printed before larger print jobs and print jobs are processed from a single print queue implemented as a priority queue). The system administrators would like to compare the time required to process a set of print jobs using 1, 2, or 3 system printers. Write a program which simulates processing 100 print jobs of varying lengths using either 1, 2, or 3 printers. Assume that a print request is made every minute and that the number of pages to print varies from 1 to 50 pages. To be fair, you will need to process the same set of print jobs each time you add a printer. The output from your program should indicate the order in which the jobs were received, the order in which they were printed, and the time required to process the set of print jobs. If more than one printer is being used, indicate which printer each job was printed on.
